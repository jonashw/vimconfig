This is my humble configuration for vim, which I have cobbled together over 4 years.  It is not highly customized; it merely contains a few nice things that I have come to depend on.

The configuration has not changed much in the past year because I switched to emacs for most of my development needs.  I still use vim, since it still performs advanced macros faster than emacs or VsVim (the Visual Studio plugin I use for vim-like keybindings).

Note: To use, you'll likely need to create a symbolic link to `_vimrc` from your home directory.
